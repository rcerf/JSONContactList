# Marionette-esque Mixin Framework

I decided to build a framework to help me structure a simple contacts web app, this was the result.

I used mixins to extend the functionality to newly instantiated objects.

## Features:
* Models
* Collections
* Regions
* ItemView
* CollectionView
* CompositeView
* Eventing system w/ event bubbline and inheritance
* templating engine similar to underscore's _.template
